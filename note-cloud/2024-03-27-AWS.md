# AWS Overview

## AMI - Region Scope
- Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are scoped to regions.

## Cross-Version Copy API Encryption
- When using the Copy API, encryption can be applied.

## AMI Actions - Launch Instance from AMI
- AMIs can be used to launch instances.

## EC2 Region Specificity
- EC2 instances, security groups, and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) are region-specific.

## Scaling
### Vertical Scaling (Scale Up/Down)
- Adjusting resources vertically on a single instance.
    - Advantage: Reduces maintenance overhead of multiple smaller instances.
    - Implementation.

### Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out/In)
- Increasing or decreasing the number of instances.
    - Advantage: Avoids cluster failure and interruptions.
    - Implementation: Best practice for complex and computation-heavy workloads, prioritize horizontal scaling, and use Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) for load balancing.

## EC2 Instance Initialization
- Choose instance families like t2, t3, c4, c5, related to compute or general purposes.

## EC2 Instance Stopping
- Stopping an EC2 instance avoids charges for RAM and CPU but incurs charges for DISK (EBS) and snapshots.

## Tagging
- Maximum of 50 tags can be added.

## Snapshot
- Snapshots represent a point in time.

## Account Sharing Feature
- Share AWS resources via AWS Account numbers.

## AMI and Snapshot Relationship
- Each AMI corresponds to one snapshot; deregistering an AMI deletes the associated snapshot.

## Region and Availability Zone (AZ)
- Regions consist of two or more Availability Zones.

## Cross-Country Operations
- Data synchronization and other cross-country operations.

## Region Verification
- Check AWS infrastructure details at https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/.

## Investment Retrieval Conditions
- Conditions for investment retrieval.

## Default VPCs per Region
- Each region has a default of 5 Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).

## AWS Resource Cost Estimation
- Estimate AWS resource costs using the AWS Pricing Calculator.

## VPC and EC2 Scope
- VPCs and EC2 instances are scoped to regions.

## Volume Types
- Different types include General Purpose (gp3, io, Magnetic).

## EC2 Instance Termination Behavior
- If 'Delete Termination' is not selected, EBS volumes are not deleted when terminating EC2 instances.

## Security Group
- Protects EC2 instances at the instance level; multiple security groups can be associated with one instance.

## Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)
- Acts as a firewall for subnets; one NACL can be used for multiple subnets, and each subnet has one NACL.

## AWS Resource IDs
- Distinguish between default AWS-generated IDs and user-generated IDs.

## Default NACL
- Both custom and default VPCs have a default NACL.

## NACL Rule Priority
- NACL rules are processed from lowest to highest rule number.

## Internet Gateway
- Each VPC is attached to one Internet Gateway, which is scalable and reliable.

## Custom VPC and Gateway
- Custom VPCs can be attached to gateways.

## Subnet and Route Table
- Subnets are associated with route tables.

## Security Group Rules
- Maximum of 5 security groups (stateful) can be associated with a resource.

## Security Group and NACL Behavior
- Security groups evaluate all rules, while NACLs match the first rule.
